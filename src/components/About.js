          Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. Life is a
          challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it. Life is a sacrifice
          - offer it. Life is love - enjoy it. I slept and dreamt that life was
          joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold,
          service was joy. Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes.
          Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality.
          Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like. Nothing
          in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time
          to understand more, so that we may fear less.

        Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.
        Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.
        The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.
        Once you bring life into the world, you must protect it. We must protect it by changing the world.
